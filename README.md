# Core Bluetooth HRM
An Xcode 9 project written in Swift 4 code to communicate with a wearable heart rate monitor using the Core Bluetooth framework.

In the [tutorial for this code](), I'll explain the essential concepts behind Bluetooth® technology, show you how getting proficient in Bluetooth® software development presents you with a tremendous career opportunity, remind you that you can't distribute an app that uses Bluetooth® without determining if you need to go through "qualification," provide you with an overview of Apple's `Core Bluetooth` framework, and finally, walk you through the development of an iOS app in Swift 4 that monitors a person's heart rate via `Core Bluetooth` and a Bluetooth® heart rate monitor -- a "wearable" -- device. Here’s what my app looks like when scanning for a heart rate monitor (HRM), and what it looks like when connected to and reading heart rate data from an HRM -- all wirelessly:
